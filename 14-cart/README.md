# Important Project: Cart

Following are the features of the Cart project: 
1. Use of **svg** icons
2. **Use Reducer:** Needs a reducer function which updates state containing all the state variables
3. **Spread operator** is necessary when passing state object as context
4. Anything added to **AppProvider** and passed to **AppContext.Provider** can be accessed by the whole app
5. **Context** and **Reducer** act as interfaces to handle the functionality
6. The arguments to the reducer method are passed as **payload**(convention) and the **type**(mandatory).
7. Javascript **reduce** method: Argument 1 is the callback method and Argument 2 is the returned object and its initial values. First argument for the reduce callback method is the objects to be returned
8. Fetching data needs to be with **async** functions
