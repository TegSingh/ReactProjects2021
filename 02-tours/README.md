## Tours Project

This project emphasizes on the following topics in React
1. Fetching data from URL using Async Await method

2. Conditional Rendering/
**Note:** This is used when the rendering is based on a condition. The condition is usually a value that is specified in the state

3. Try and Catch blocks in javascript/
**Note:** These blocks are used in conjunction with fetching data so it can catch and display the error

4. UseEffect hook and the associated dependency array/
**Note:** This is used to add side effects for a render. The dependecy array defines when the rerender should take place

5. Nested Components/
**Note:** This React functionality is commonly used when the multiple components need to be rendered

6. Object Destructuring/
**Note:** The name of the destructured properties should be the same as the ones in the original object, especially if its fetched from an API. The ordering does not matter as long as the names match

7. Toggle buttons/
**Note:** These buttons are usually associated with boolean state values and are usually set using setValue(!value)/
Used here for ReadMore value

8. Map and Filter method for array
**Note:** This is used for lists and removing elements from the lists

9. Prop Drilling
**Note:** Used in case of nested components where methods/values can't be used directly by the next level component/
Used here for Not Interested button
