# react-projects-5-menu

Following is the list of topics revised in this project along with notable features
1. **Dynamically Generated buttons**
2. When a **function** needs to be passed as **prop**, we can pass it without an arrow function. If it's an **event handler**, say, for a button, and needs to be executed there and then, it should be passed as an arrow function
3. **Javascript Set** and helpful variation of **spread operator**
4. Helpful variation of **map** function
5. **NOTE:** Do not use anything other than setValue to set value
